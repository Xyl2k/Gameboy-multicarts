## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome, please first discuss the change/additions you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making any changes.\
Please use a scanner to scan the front and back of your cartridge plus the PCB, if the scan focus of the PCB isn't clear enough you can take a photo.

Dump of the menu contained in the eeprom is also welcome.\
If you can't dump the eeprom, a screenshot of the menu is recommended.


**For dumping:**\
I use an Arduino Uno with a Gameboy Cart Shield v1.1 from InsideGadget (Discontinued, but seem they sold now "GBxCart RW", wich looks less primitive than what i currently use)


**For screenshoting:**\
I use a Analogue Super Nt with the Super Gameboy 2 and a Elgato Game Capture HD behind the Super NT. (that a lot of hardware just for taking a screenshot but at least there is no blur.)
